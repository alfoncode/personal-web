Welcome to my blog about software development, blockchain, entrepreneurship, investment and new technologies.

My name is Alfonso García and, although I am a Technical Telecommunications Engineer specializing in Telematics, I work as a Senior Software Engineer in a technology consultancy.
Since I was very young I have been passionate about new technologies. I have worked on research projects and made some international publication in science journals [Cloud-based monitoring system for lysimetric and agroclimatic data] (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11119-017-9542-5), as freelance developer, entrepreneur and as software engineer. I have been technical lead and project manager of projects with up to 25 people and currently I belong to the devops architecture group of a major company in the banking sector.

In addition to software development, I am passionate about the world of entrepreneurship, investment and blockchain.
